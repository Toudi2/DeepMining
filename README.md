# DeepMining
DeepMining a mod for Factorio.

### Long Description
This mods adds mid/late game infinite resource mine that generates small amounts of random ores (iron, copper, coal) and stone using concrete and explosives.

The items are expensive by design (to have a resource sink for mid/late game)

There are 3 tiers of miners, each faster and more polluting than previous one.
There is also an advanced recipe for late game using more explosives but yielding more resources.
